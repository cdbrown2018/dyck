This project satisfies a course requirement for the University of Dayton's CPS 352 (Emerging Programming Languages) course. The project has defined its own language, with several recognized words and sentence structures. The goal of the project is to read text from Standard Input, and determine if the text forms a valid sentence under the rules of the made up language.

This program is largely a novelty, but shows the basic concepts behind a compiler's job - at least when it comes to ensuring program syntax and structure is correct.
